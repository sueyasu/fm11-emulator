# FM-11 Emulator

Linux port and ongoing development of the FM-11 emulator.

This first revision establishes a portable CMake build for the existing 6809/6309 and Z80 CPU cores. The Windows MFC/Direct3D frontend is intentionally not part of the Linux build.

## Build

```sh
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

## Current scope

- Portable fixed-width compatibility types for legacy `BYTE`, `WORD`, `DWORD`, and `LONG` usage.
- Existing `Sim09` 6809/6309 instruction core compiled as portable C++.
- Existing `SimZ80` instruction core compiled as portable C++.
- Legacy MFC register-window callbacks removed from the portable core.
- Z80's FM-11-specific memory/MMR wiring is deliberately not embedded in the CPU core. The initial portable hook uses the supplied flat `Memory` buffer; board-specific address translation will be added in the CPU-board layer.

No SDL frontend or complete FM-11 machine is implemented yet.

## Headless serial CPU runner (experimental)

On Linux, `fm11-headless` runs an MC6809/HD6309 raw binary with
standard input/output connected to the main RS-232C byte queues.
It is intended for early serial driver bring-up, **not** NitrOS-9 booting:
there is no IPL, disk controller, OS image loader or execution pacing yet.

```sh
./build/fm11-headless --binary program.bin --load 0x1000 --pc 0x1000 --cpu 6809 --clock 2000000
```

Use `--instructions 100000` for a bounded smoke run. Ctrl-C stops an
unbounded run. Input is processed without canonical line buffering when
attached to a TTY; the original terminal settings are restored on exit.
